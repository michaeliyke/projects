package server

// This space is empty for now
// This is on purpose to make the codebase as simple as possible
// Each folder here is upposed to be a package.
// This way, things are completely decoupled

// In the future, there could be immediate code on this folder
// to go by the name 'package server' but . . .
// it must be absolutely necessary, and for good reasons
